- **Avatar images** have proper `alt` text and role descriptions

#### Complex Components
- **Photo upload section** uses `role="img"` with descriptive labels
- **Form sections** are properly labeled with `aria-labelledby`
- **Status indicators** use appropriate ARIA live regions

### 2. Keyboard Navigation Support

#### Navigation Shortcuts
- **Alt + 1**: Navigate to photo profile section
- **Alt + 2**: Navigate to personal data section

- **Focus restoration** after modal interactions
- **Skip links** for keyboard users to jump to main content

### 3. Heading Hierarchy and Screen Reader Compatibility

#### Proper Structure
- **Single H1** element as main page heading: "Meu Perfil"
- **H2 elements** for major sections:
  - "Foto de Perfil"
  - "Dados Pessoais" 
  - "Alterar Senha"
- **Logical hierarchy** without level skipping
- **Descriptive headings** that clearly identify section content

#### Landmarks
- **Header landmark** (`role="banner"`) for page header

- **Section landmarks** with proper `aria-labelledby` references
- **Form landmarks** with descriptive labels

#### Screen Reader Support
- **Screen reader only text** using `.sr-only` class for additional context
- **Live regions** for dynamic content announcements
- **Proper semantic markup** for all content structures
- **Alternative text** for all meaningful images

### 4. Focus Management and Error Announcements

#### Focus Indicators
- **Visible focus rings** on all interactive elements
- **High contrast focus indicators** using amber color scheme
- **Consistent focus styling** across all components
- **Focus management** for complex interactions

#### Error Handling
- **Real-time validation** with immediate feedback
- **Error announcements** via ARIA live regions
- **Success confirmations** announced to screen readers
- **Error summaries** at form level when needed
- **Contextual error messages** linked to specific fields

#### Live Regions
- **Polite announcements** for status updates and confirmations
- **Assertive announcements** for errors and critical information
- **Validation status** announced as users type
- **Operation progress** announced during uploads and saves

### 5. Color Contrast and WCAG Compliance

#### Color Combinations Tested
All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 ratio):

- **Primary text** (zinc-100 on zinc-900): ✅ Passes
- **Secondary text** (zinc-400 on zinc-900): ✅ Passes  
- **Accent color** (amber-500 on zinc-900): ✅ Passes
- **Button text** (zinc-900 on amber-500): ✅ Passes
- **Error text** (red-400 on zinc-900): ✅ Passes
- **Success text** (green-400 on zinc-900): ✅ Passes

#### Visual Indicators
- **Required field markers** (*) with sufficient contrast
- **Validation states** use color plus icons/text
- **Loading states** have visual and text indicators
- **Status messages** use appropriate color coding with text
