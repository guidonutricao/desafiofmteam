## Integration Summary

The celebration page has been successfully integrated into the main application flow:

1. **Route Configuration**: Added `/celebration` route to App.tsx that renders the CelebrationPage component without the Layout wrapper for full-screen experience.

2. **Automatic Redirection**: Modified DesafioDiario.tsx to automatically redirect users to the celebration page when `challengeProgress.isCompleted` is true, replacing the previous static completion message.

3. **User Experience**: Users now get the full celebration experience with animations, statistics, social sharing, and lead generation CTA instead of the basic completion message.

4. **Data Integration**: The celebration page automatically fetches and displays the user's challenge data using the existing hooks and data structure.

The implementation ensures that when users complete their 7-day challenge, they are immediately redirected to the rich, animated celebration page that was designed and implemented according to all the specified requirements.
